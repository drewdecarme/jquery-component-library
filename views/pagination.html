        <p>When I was working with GE Healthcare, I worked on an application that returned a massive amount of data from one of our Oracle implementations' staging environments. Since I couldn’t massage the data on the back end, I needed a way to present the data on the front end without making the user break their mouse's scroll wheel.</p>
		
		<p>I figured the best way to go about that was to create a pagination plugin on the front end. Since it goes against my morale fabric to develop non-reusable code, I decided to create a pagination plugin to help manage the records. The only requirement was that the user needed the ability to manage how many records they wanted to see per page.</p>
		
		<p>I developed the plugin by extending jQuery to the selector of the table and storing its data through the <a href="https://api.jquery.com/data/" target="_blank">$.data()</a> method. This way, I could initialize it up front, and then access the class that is created by just referencing the selectors data. It also allows me to attach data to the selector in a way that is safe from circular references and therefore from memory leaks. (stole that line from the documentation).</p>
		
		<p>I also wanted the ability to give a finite amount of pages in the pagination. Simply put, if there were 10,000 records, I didn’t want to display 1 thru 100 in the pagination buttons. I restricted the pagination to only display 5 numbers and then update dynamically based upon where the user was in the pages. This way the user could only see 5 numbers at a time.</p>

		<p>Check it out below.</p>

		<p>PS - I created the table CSS using Sass just because looking at a webkit table SUCKS.</p>
